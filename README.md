Gollum based Wiki

Experimenting with having a personal Wiki for notes, cheat sheets, et cetera. Apple Notes, and the macOS required Quiver app, are fine tools, but require Apple devices. OneNote is web-based but cumbersome and too much like Microsoft Word, which is bloated.

Gollum is the Wiki engine behind Github's Wikis. It uses Markdown, and it works as a git repository.
